                    Breakbeat is a term combining a class of electronic music
                    genres based on a percussion part with a broken rhythm, or
                    these percussion parts themselves. The "breakage" of the
                    rhythm is achieved by shifting the emphasis from the strong
                    parts of the beat to the weak ones, or by simultaneously
                    combining two or more independent rhythms.
